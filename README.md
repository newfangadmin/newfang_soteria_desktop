# Bastion

> A dropbox clone demo desktop application to showcase the Newfang Desktop SDK

## About
- Platforms are hard to demo. So, we developed Bastion as a means to showcase the Newfang Platform.
- This is just a PoC. Expect it to be rough around the edges.
- Please report any issues or bugs and help us improve it.
- Bastion comes with 1GB of free storage and 1GB of free bandwidth for you to test.
- **Bastion and our SDK are highly experimental at this point. DO NOT upload anything important or without a backup.**

## SDK
- This repo does not come with the Newfang SDK which you will need to perform upload/download.
- Reach out to us @ **hello@newfang.io** or visit the [Newfang Website](https://newfang.io) to download the SDK.
- For ready-to-test builds, which come bundled with our SDK, download OS specific installers from the [PoC Page](https://newfang.io/poc.html) on the Newfang website.
